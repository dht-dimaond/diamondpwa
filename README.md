I have a code base for a telegram mini app. It uses firestore and telegram API to validate and verify user and all that ,  but i am changing it to clerk + neon +  , so I would like to keep all the logic of the code base , but remove all the telegram API stuff component by component  logic by logic to fit the usage of my new system . so far I have integrated the authentication and the database , so i would be pasting each component and reviewing your change to make sure you understand my request and what I want to achieve . do you understand ?
